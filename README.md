#### Development Process
    After writing down a user story for a small business I created basic schema for tables and a basic dashboard-ui design, 
    Focused on setting up the BACK-END environment primarily until json data was available,
    Switched to FRONT-END to style a front end frame display GET data and perform a PUT via UI,
    Having a better understanding of BACK-END & FRONT-END interaction I alternated adding a new API and incorporating it to the UI
